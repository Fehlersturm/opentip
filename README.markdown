# Opentip
The [opentip][opentip]-class is a free opensource Java-Script tooltip class based on the [prototype][prototype] framework.

It supports:

- Stems (little pointers)
- Automatic content download with [AJAX][ajax]
- Different styles
- Automatic repositioning of the tooltip if it's not in the viewport of the browser anymore
- All kind of triggers (The tooltip can be triggered by mouse over, click, form submit, â€¦ everything you can think of really)
- CSS3 Animations if available. (If not, it uses scriptaculous if available).

As of Version 1.2.6 Opentip does no longer depend on scriptaculous.

## Usage

    <div onmouseover="javascript:Tips.add(this, event, 'Content', { options });"></div>

Or the preferred external method:

	$('elementId').addTip('Content', { options });
